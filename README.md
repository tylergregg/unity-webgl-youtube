# unity-webgl-youtube
Add youtube embeds to a Unity WebGL build.

## What?
Videos are played in iframes, just like normal youtube embeds. The iframes are transformed with 3D CSS, and are then visible behind transparent areas of the Unity player.

There's a demo here: https://tylergregg.itch.io/unity-webgl-youtube. I included a [simple FPS controller](https://sharpcoderblog.com/blog/unity-3d-fps-controller) that was the second google result for "unity fps controller."  

Built with Unity 2023.1.13f1. It may very well work with earlier versions, but I haven't tried.

## Huh?
Ingredients:  

This shader, which masks everything behind it except the camera background: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72477399/occluding-parts-of-an-object-behind-a-transparent-object  

This Unity package, which makes the WebGL canvas background transparent: https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-can-i-make-the-canvas-transparent-on-webgl.831580/#post-8310864  

[three.js](https://threejs.org/) and its [CSS 3D Renderer](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/renderers/CSS3DRenderer).

Some quaternion magic from this thread, which turned out not to be entirely correct, OR (more likely) I've made a mistake somewhere: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18066581/convert-unity-transforms-to-three-js-rotations  

## How?
Extract all the files into your project. There's a sample implementation in the `YoutubeDemo` scene.

In Project Settings under Resolution & Presentation, select the "Youtube" WebGL template.  

Set your main camera clear flags to `Solid Color` with alpha = 0. Add the `WebClickHandler` components to the camera.

If you don't use the `SC_FPSController` component on your player object, note that `ProcessInput()` is called from the template at the beginning of `animate()`, and when that function is done it calls `SyncCameraTransform()` in `WebSync.jslib`. You'll need to do something similar in your implementation, and be sure to maintain the order that things happen to avoid camera lag.

You can either use the provided `YoutubeVideoPlayer` prefab, or create a quad, add the `CSS3DIframe` component, and set its xy scale to 4.8 x 3.6. This will result in a 480px x 360px iframe.
Note that only y-axis rotation is supported at the moment.

Set the iframe's `id` to something unique (like "youtubePlayer1").  
You can either add video IDs to the `videoIdList` OR select a `listType` and set `listId` to a playlist ID or youtube username. Doing the latter will override the former.

Drag the `YoutubeManager` prefab into your scene. This script sets the video titles, and also delays loading youtube's API until after Unity tells the browser to create the iframes. I don't know why this is necessary, but it doesn't work otherwise with dynamically added iframes.  

While you can run this in editor, the video players only work in a WebGL build.  

Safari, Chrome, and Firefox on Mac don't show videos when running on localhost. In Safari you can get around this by disabling the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) Header` in `Preferences`->`Feature Flags`.  
Safari (Mac and iOS) had a bug where videos wouldn't play when refreshing the page. It doesn't happen when the iframes are predefined, so in `index.html` you'll see a bunch of iframes with the same `youtubeStaticPlayer` id. If that isn't enough to handle all the videos in your scene, copy and paste that iframe declaration as many times as you need. It's messy, but I couldn't find another way around the problem.

## What else?
Interaction is limited to click to play/pause/unpause and playlist next/previous buttons. Interacting with the iframes directly would require using the mouse cursor and temporarily disabling pointer events on the Unity player. This is possible, but awkward.

Fullscreen mode doesn't work yet.  

My quaternion math is a mess. Help.
